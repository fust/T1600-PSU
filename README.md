# T1600-PSU
Schematic and troubleshooting guide for the Toshiba T1600 Power Supply board (PSU)

The schematic is based on the FIVPS2 revision, the FIVPS3 and FIVPS4 revisions have some subtle (primarily PCB layout) changes.
The guide is centered around the FIVPS2 revision but should be applicable to the FIVPS3 and FIVPS4 revisions as well.

Any additions/corrections or suggestions for the guide are welcome, please open an issue.
